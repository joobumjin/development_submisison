                    <p>From this, I decided a few important factors that would be ideal to implement.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, sorting by added date helped me find what I had most recently liked. I think most people tend to gravitate towards the songs they liked most recently, and so this sorting order makes a lot of sense.
                        Next, multiple ways of organizing (by artist, by album) helped me find songs faster, if I had not recently added the song.
                        Then, a big list of all my songs was nice in case I wanted to see all of the songs I had liked, rather than just looking for a particular song. 
                        Finally, one click for favoriting and unfavoriting made the experience smoother in my usage. For both Apple Music and Spotify, I found it a bit annoying that I had to press into an extended menu and then had to locate the unfavorite button for each individual song.</p>

                    <p>
                        The primary work I put in was towards simultaneous filtering/sorting as well as clean aggregation. In the end, I had sorting by artist name and filtering by song length for all songs. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lately, a large trend has been in avoiding songs that are too long. For instance, many artists (e.g. New Jeans, RIIZE) have been releasing songs that hover around 2 minutes in length, or are even shorter than that.
                        I think this likely mirrors a trend in consumption where listeners are more often opting for shorter form content, as has been the case with videos (consider YouTube videos vs YouTube shorts/TikTok).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In terms of sorting, I find I might oftentimes forget the name of an individual song or album, but I rarely forget the names of artists that I really like.
                        Thus, I thought that grouping the entire list of songs based on the artist would aid in finding the songs by an artist.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For aggregation, I often find myself listening to entire albums of songs rather than individual one-offs. Thus, I decided to organize the favorited songs based on the albums.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Given that this project was meant to be a one page react app, I found it difficult to pre-emptively determine which features might be able to fit on a single page and which might 
                        instead look very cluttered or otherwise unusable on just one page. To this end, I struggled with deciding how extra filtering information should show up for a single song's card.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Additionally, I had a lot of considerations and thoughts about data storage. Given that I don't have access to any official backends for popular sites,
                        I wasn't quite sure how I should start designing the data structure in a way that would be both efficient, yet understandable.

                        Ultimately, I decided to use jsons which associate unique song/album ID numbers to their respective song/album.

                        The uniqueness of the IDs was really useful for data aggregation, as I could then design dictionaries (Objects) which used a shared aggregating feature (in my case, albums) as the key, with values being the relevant songs.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="body">
                    <p>Due to time constraints from personal issues, I ran out of time in developing a second filter.</p>

                    <p>I also did not really have time to style the website for similar reasons.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, I'm left curious about how this experience might change if I wanted to scale up the project. With hundreds, or even thousands of songs, would a simple, single json file be able to efficiently manage all of my songs?
                        How would incorporating a backend change a lot of my programming decisions and what features might be moved away from the website app itself and into backend code that might be better suited for processing a large scale of complex data?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, throughout this experience, I have definitely developed my skills and knowledge in working around JavaScript and React (+ the Material UI Component Library as well!). It was really interesting to work with JSON-type Objects directly in a frontend application and really helped me understand
                        how frontend code should be structured, split, and individually tested for functionality.
