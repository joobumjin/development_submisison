                        The goal of this project was for students to attempt building an aggregation tool (in my case, a music favoriting site), through React

                        This project used React, HTML, and CSS elements to get a working single page applicaiton.

                    <p>From this, I decided a few important factors that would be ideal to implement.                     </p>
                    <p>Firstly, sorting by added date helped me find what I had most recently liked.</p>
                    <p>Next, multiple ways of organizing (by artist, by album) helped me find songs faster</p>
                    <p>Then, a big list of all my songs was nice in case I wanted to see them all</p>
                    <p>Finally, one click for favoriting and unfavoriting made the experience smoother in my usage.</p>

                    <p>Due to time constraints from personal issues, I ran out of time in developing a second filter.</p>

                    <p>I also did not really have time to style the website for similar reasons.</p>

                    <p>
                        However, the primary work I did put in was towards simultaneous filtering/sorting as well as clean aggregation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Given that this project was meant to be a one page react app, I found it difficult to pre-emptively determine which features might be able to fit on a single page and which might 
                        instead look very cluttered or otherwise unusable on just one page. To this end, I struggled with deciding how extra filtering information should show up for a single song's card.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Additionally, I had a lot of considerations and thoughts about data storage. Given that I don't have access to any official backends for popular sites,
                        I wasn't quite sure how I should start designing the data structure in a way that would be both efficient, yet understandable.

                        Ultimately, I decided to use jsons which associate unique song/album ID numbers to their respective song/album.

                        The uniqueness of the IDs was really useful for data aggregation, as I could then design dictionaries (Objects) which used a shared aggregating feature (in my case, albums) as the key, with values being the relevant songs.
